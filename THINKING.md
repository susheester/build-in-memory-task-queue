# Thinking Log

<!-- This is your scratchpad. Fill it in AS YOU GO, not at the end.
     Rough, fragmentary, honest. Don't polish it.
     Read the README for guidance on how to use this file. -->

## Initial Reaction

<!-- First 5 minutes, before you touch any code. -->
     - What's your gut take on the problem?
This looks like creating a job scheduler with different components such as job queues, timers, concurrent jobs, delays, failure mode handling.
     - What feels like the hard part?
     May be working on retry with delay and shutdown, how to handle this part - "the delayed tasks shouldn’t take a concurrency slot"
     Can I use semaphores?
     - What approaches do you see? Which would you rule out and why?
     I used semaphores in my previous projects to handle such job scheduling. 
     - Anything you're already unsure about? 
     There are several Job schedulers such as Airflow, Control-M etc.. out there that can do these jobs in an easier and time efficient way rather than building something of this kind from scratch.

## Plan

<!-- Still before coding (or right at the start).
     - How will you structure this? Files, types, main components.
     - What are the key design decisions you're making up front?
     - What are you deliberately deferring?
     - What will you build FIRST — the smallest slice that proves something useful? -->

## Progress Notes

<!-- Drop an entry any time you:
     - change direction from your plan
     - hit something unexpected
     - make a trade-off
     - realise you were wrong about something
     - finish a chunk and start the next

     One or two sentences each is fine. Timestamp each one.
     Imagine your pair partner just asked "what are you doing?" — answer that.
     Add as many entries as you need. -->

## Research / References

<!-- Optional. Any docs, articles, past code, or language references you looked at.
     A one-line note on what you took from each is enough. -->

## Retrospective

<!-- After you're done. This section is NOT optional — it's one of the most
     valuable parts of the submission. Be honest.

     - What's the weakest part of your solution? Where's the duct tape?
     - Where would this break in production?
     - What would you do differently with more time?
     - What surprised you about this problem?
     - Anything you tried and threw away? Why? -->
